Certainly! I will Fact Check the answer to the question.
1. The question asks about the largest planet in our solar system.
2. The context clearly states that Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System.
3. The proposed answer label "Saturn" does not match this information.
4. The answer is incorrect based on the given context.

Conclusion:
The proposed answer "Saturn" is incorrect. The context explicitly states that Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System, contradicting the proposed answer.
