a) Subject: Capital of Germany; Timeframe:  1949 to 1990
b) Context provides information about the capitals during this period (Bonn and East Berlin)
c) Context also mentions Berlin's status before 1949 and after 1990
d) Proposed answer claims the information is not specified, which contradicts the context
e) The context actually provides clear information for the entire specified timeframe
f) The proposed answer is incomplete as it fails to acknowledge the information present
g) The context provides information for timeframes both within and outside the question's timeframe

Conclusion:
The proposed answer "Not specified in the given time frame" is incorrect. The context clearly specifies that from 1949 to 1990, Bonn was the capital of West Germany and East Berlin was the capital of East Germany. This information directly corresponds to the timeframe mentioned in the question.
