To determine if the context supports the claim that the correct answer to the question "What was the last stop on Line 7 of the Beijing subway from Dec 2014 to Dec 2019?" is "Chaoyang and Tongzhou Districts," let's analyze the provided information step by step:

Phase 1 Operation: Full operation began on December 28, 2014, except for Shuangjing and Fatou stations.
Infill Stations: Fatou station opened on December 30, 2018, and Shuangjing station on December 28, 2019.
Phase 2 Operation: The eastern extension (Phase 2) opened on December 28, 2019, except for Universal Resort station. This extension runs through Chaoyang and Tongzhou Districts.
From this information:

From December 28, 2014, to December 30, 2018, the last stop would be the furthest station eastward on Phase I.
After December 30, 2018, it includes Fatou station until December 28, 2019.
On December 28, 2019, the eastern extension opened, adding more stations through Chaoyang and Tongzhou Districts.
The context mentions Chaoyang and Tongzhou Districts but does not specify them as individual stops or the last stop. Therefore, the context does not support the claim that these districts were the last stop from Dec 2014 to Dec 2019.
