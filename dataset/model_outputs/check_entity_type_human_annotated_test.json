His career spanned several decades, and he worked in various locations throughout his life.\n\nFrom the information provided, we know that Max Weber worked between the years 1891 and 1905. To determine if Brooklyn could be a location where he worked during this period, we need to consider his known activities and movements during that time frame.\n\nWeber moved to Munich in 1889, where he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts. After completing his studies, he continued to live and work in Munich until 1905. It is during this time that he developed his signature style and became associated with the Blaue Reiter group.\n\nGiven that Brooklyn is located in New York City, which is far from Munich, it is unlikely that Max Weber would have worked there within the specified timeframe.
